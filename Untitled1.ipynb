    "The Internet's dark side is seen in toxic online comments that have been escalating each year. Major news organizations like CNN and Reuters are shutting down comment sections due to abusive behavior and poor quality comments. For our project we are attempting a task to classify online toxic comments from non-toxic comments to improve online discussion environment."
